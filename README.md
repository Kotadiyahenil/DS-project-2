# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

# 📖 Overview

In today's digital age, understanding public sentiment on social media platforms like Twitter is invaluable for businesses, analysts, and researchers. This project focuses on analyzing Twitter data to predict the sentiment of tweets—classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide insights into public opinion and trends.

# 🎯 Objectives

Data Analysis: Explore and identify patterns within the Twitter dataset to understand factors influencing sentiment polarity.

Model Development: Build and train machine learning models to accurately predict the sentiment of tweets.

Deployment: Develop a user-friendly application for real-time sentiment prediction.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK

Web Framework: Flask

Deployment: Flask application for real-time sentiment analysis

# 📊 Data Exploration

The dataset comprises tweets labeled with their corresponding sentiments. Key steps in data exploration include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and preprocessing text (e.g., removing URLs, mentions, and special characters).

Visualization: Generating plots to visualize the distribution of sentiments and common words or phrases associated with each sentiment category.

# 🧠 Model Development

We employed various machine learning models to predict tweet sentiments:

Logistic Regression: A baseline model to assess initial performance.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): To capture complex patterns in the data.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM: Leveraging deep learning for sequential data analysis.

# Feature Extraction:

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical features.

Tokenization: Preparing text for deep learning models.

# Performance Metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.

Precision, Recall, F1-Score: To evaluate model performance, especially in handling imbalanced classes.

# 🚀 Deployment

The trained model is deployed using a Flask web application, allowing users to input tweets and receive real-time sentiment predictions.
